I contribute to Github in my spare time, outside my formal work requirements. My main focus is to learn quantum computing. Here are some of my contributions:
- [Direct fidelity estimation](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.py) and its associated [Notebook](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.ipynb)
- [MPSSimulator](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/cirq/contrib/quimb/mps_simulator.py)
- [Stabilizer codes](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3935)
- I also do some cleanup and refactoring.

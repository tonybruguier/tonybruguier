I contribute to Github in my spare time, outside my formal work requirements. My main focus is to learn quantum computing. Here are some of my contributions:
- [Direct fidelity estimation](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.py) ([commits](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.py)) and its associated [Notebook](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.ipynb)
- [MPSSimulator](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/contrib/quimb/mps_simulator.py) ([commits](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/cirq/contrib/quimb/mps_simulator.py))
- [Stabilizer codes](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/stabilizer_code.py) ([commits](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/examples/stabilizer_code.py)) and its associated [Notebook](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/stabilizer_code.ipynb)
- Arbitrary Boolean functions for QAOA - [Main PR](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3989) and [Boolean expression](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3989), both under review
- I also do some cleanup and refactoring. See [all my PRs](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=author%3Atonybruguier-google+author%3Atonybruguier&s=created&type=Issues).

I contribute to Github in my spare time, outside my formal work requirements. My main focus is to learn quantum computing. Here are some of my contributions:
- [Direct fidelity estimation](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.py) ([commits](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.py)) and its associated [Notebook](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/direct_fidelity_estimation.ipynb)
- [MPSSimulator](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/contrib/quimb/mps_simulator.py) ([original](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3630) and [subsquent](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/cirq/contrib/quimb/mps_simulator.py) commits)
- [Stabilizer codes](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/stabilizer_code.py) for error correction ([commits](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/commits/master/examples/stabilizer_code.py)) and its associated [Notebook](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/stabilizer_code.ipynb)
- Arbitrary Boolean functions for QAOA - [Boolean expression](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4282) merged, [Boolean Hamiltonian Gate](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4309) merged, [Complete plan](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3989) not yet for review
- [Quantum Embeddings](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/research/quantum_embed/quantum_embed.py) and its associated [Notebook](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/research/quantum_embed/quantum_embed.ipynb) ([commit](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/pull/606))
- [ProjectorString](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4331) objects in Cirq and for TensorFlow quantum, merged, and [ProjectorSum](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4364), under review.
- I also do some cleanup and refactoring. See [all my PRs](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=author%3Atonybruguier-google+author%3Atonybruguier&s=created&type=Issues).
